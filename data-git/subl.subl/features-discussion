(Here are ideas for Cyc-mode features
	(Keep all the kinds of interaction classified within Cyc)
	(Keep everything modelled within Cyc, but then translated
	      into other code.)
	(Do lots of exploring with it, in fact, keep track of which
	    constants I have studied.)
	(create a buffer for communication between cyc and emacs)
	(put everything in cvs)
	(before much else, should have the capability to generate
		full subl commands))
