21:05:02 <aindilis2> Hi, I am writing an Emacs major mode for cyc
21:05:08 <aindilis2> also a perl mode
21:05:11 <aindilis2> perl api I mean
21:05:25 <aindilis2> and I'm just looking for some help with the #$constant
      syntax
21:05:35 <aindilis2> I have a mode, called KBS-mode, which works with KIF
21:05:54 <aindilis2> and it translates it to this weird format I wrote which
      isn't terribly well thought out
21:06:47 <aindilis2> so for instance KIF's (and ?X ?Y) would look like ("and"
      var-X var-Y) to Emacs, to Perl it would be ["and", \*{'::?X'},
      \*{'::?Y'}].
21:07:32 <aindilis2> so I'm writing a couple of different modes.  I feel like
      an idiot asking if there is already an Emacs mode for Cyc.  There has to
      be.  Some kind of ilisp or something
21:07:57 <aindilis2> some of them are pure elisp - so that others may use them
21:08:07 <aindilis2> the others, do IPC through my "MAS" called UniLang
21:08:16 <aindilis2> those are the hybrid modes
21:08:40 <aindilis2> I'm running into a problem printing from emacs data
      structures to perl data structures from within emacs
21:10:02 <aindilis2> the #$constant notation is causing me some issues,
      because I don't readily see how to singly quote something (and escape
      all inside single quotes etc) using Emacs, and so I'm using double
      quotes, but silly Emacs makes it darned near impossible to quote the $,
      which is a special character to Perl double-quoted strings.
21:10:59 <aindilis2> Emacs allow "$" or "\\$" but not "\$"
21:13:34 <aindilis2> I asked in #emacs and they recommended I talk to you Doug
21:14:43 <aindilis2> dmiles: hey
