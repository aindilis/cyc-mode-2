(figure out how to get documentation on a subl function from the subl
	interactor)
(figure out how to get the argument types of subl
	functions from the subl interactor)
(figure out how to get the next
	entity types in a grammar of subl and cycl, like that time we saw it
	dump <A> <WHOLE> <LOT> <OF> <THESE>)
(figure out how to get it to return all results instead of
	a (result1 result2 ...) format at the subl interactor)
(figure out how to do tab completion of subl-interactor and cycl
	using command references (apropos ""), cycl
	apropos (constant-apropos "") and the grammar, etc)
