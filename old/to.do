(Need to write this mode to be effective at maintaining logs of opencyc
 usage, and have various  capabilities, like load transcript files, and
 interact with an emacs mode.  or have various scripted shortcuts.)
(subl command:
 '(apropos "parse")')


(Here are ideas for Cyc-mode features
 (Keep all the kinds of interaction classified within Cyc)
 (Keep everything modelled within Cyc, but then translated
  into other code.)
 (Do lots of exploring with it, in fact, keep track of which
  constants I have studied.)
 (create a buffer for communication between cyc and emacs)
 (put everything in cvs)
 (before much else, should have the capability to generate
  full subl commands)
 (have a state machine system to represent )
 )
